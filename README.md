My minor project:
        It's just about standardization and normalization of given data which is a part of data preprocessing.
        
My major project:
        For Marketing purposes in the retail industry one company wants refined customer data , we need to use any unsupervised ML algorithm and build at least  3 or 4  groups, so that company can target particular customers.I used KMeans clusters for divideding the customers into various groups.
